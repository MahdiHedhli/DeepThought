# Threat model — Evaluation Contract (008)

The threat here is not an attacker; it is **honest numbers quietly drifting**. A
benchmark degrades when an exclusion happens without a record: a hard case is
dropped, a cohort is re-pinned easier, a "blind" set is peeked at, a curator grades
its own work. This model enumerates the exclusion-leak vectors a cross-model review
(Claude + Sol / GPT-5.6) surfaced and maps each to the requirement that seals it.
The unifying rule: **every exclusion is a logged, reviewable, versioned event.**

## Exclusion-leak vectors → mitigations

| # | Leak | How the score drifts up | Sealed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Drop a hard case | Denominator shrinks; rate rises | FR-3 denominator preservation; FR-8 exclusion log; AC-3 |
| L2 | Re-pin to an easier commit | Same class, weaker ground truth | FR-1 identity hash over `vuln_ref`/`patched_ref`; FR-2 version bump; AC-2 |
| L3 | Narrow `target_paths` / edit `sink_probe` | Detector's easy region only | FR-1 (both are canonical fields); AC-1 |
| L4 | Peek at the blind set while tuning | Blind becomes a tuning oracle | FR-7 zero pre-freeze, one post-freeze; AC-7 |
| L5 | Curator scores its own cohort | Subject has seen the answers | FR-6 exposure ledger, curator ≠ subject; AC-6 |
| L6 | Call patched-tree flags "false positives" | Inflates precision, or hides a real other bug | FR-9 recall/precision split + blind adjudication; FR-10 re-gate real-other-finding; AC-9, AC-10 |
| L7 | Slip synthetic mutations into the CVE metric | Real-code ground truth diluted | FR-11 synthetic separation + removal proof; AC-11 |
| L8 | Reclassify a miss as "unachievable" | Exclusion wearing a taxonomy | FR-12 append-only, falsifiable, authoritative stays all-pinned; AC-12 |
| L9 | Headline the fixed-cohort or achievable number | Inflation we already exposed | FR-13 blind-led reporting; AC-13 |
| L10 | Silent history edit on correction | Old results rewritten to match | FR-2 immutable versions; AC-2 |

## Two classification rules that do the heavy lifting

- **Unsupported analysis counts as a MISS**, inside the denominator — not an
  exclusion. "We don't parse this language" is a capability gap, not a reason the
  case stops counting. (FR-3, FR-8)
- **Infrastructure failure INVALIDATES the run** — it does not silently leave the
  denominator. Fetch failure, crash, timeout, malformed SARIF, budget truncation,
  repo disappearance are infrastructure-class `ExclusionEvent`s that block the run;
  they never quietly shrink the denominator. (FR-8, FR-7 infra-retry rule)

Any legitimate cohort correction creates a **new cohort version**; it never edits
history (FR-2).

## Sealing note (for the later cross-model evaluator)

The exposure ledger and freeze manifest are the in-contract guarantees. The OS-level
boundary they presuppose is out of scope here but stated so it is not forgotten: a
separate git worktree is **insufficient**, because a builder agent runs as the same
OS user and could read a cohort on disk. The evaluator cohort needs a capability
boundary — an encrypted bundle or an evaluator-only mount, ideally a separate UID or
container, with the decryption key never present in the builder environment. The
builder receives only the class contract, one calibration seed, the detector
interface, and regression fixtures. After the builder freezes, its environment is
hash-frozen and copied read-only to the evaluator, which unseals and evaluates once.

A `policy_refusal` (a builder declining on policy grounds) is recorded as a
task-completion failure with detector score **N/A** — never 0, which would falsely
imply a detector was measured.
